      Swimming is the self-propulsion of a person through water, usually for
      recreation, sport, exercise, or survival. Locomotion is achieved through
      coordinated movement of the limbs, the body, or both. Humans can hold
      their breath underwater and undertake rudimentary locomotive swimming
      within weeks of birth, as a survival response.

      Swimming is consistently among the top public recreational activities, and
      in some countries, swimming lessons are a compulsory part of the
      educational curriculum. As a formalized sport, swimming features in a
      range of local, national, and international competitions, including every
      modern Summer Olympics.
