      Jogging is a form of trotting or running at a slow or leisurely pace. The
      main intention is to increase physical fitness with less stress on the
      body than from faster running but more than walking, or to maintain a
      steady speed for longer periods of time. Performed over long distances, it
      is a form of aerobic endurance training.

      Jogging is running at a gentle pace, its definition, as compared with
      running, is not standard. One definition describes jogging as running
      slower than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h). Running is sometimes defined as
      requiring a moment of no contact to the ground, whereas jogging often
      sustains the contact.
