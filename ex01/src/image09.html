      Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other
      animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized
      by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there
      are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always
      in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the
      center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted
      pendulum fashion. A feature of a running body from the viewpoint of
      spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy
      within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by
      springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer
      to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting.

      Running in humans is associated with improved health and life expectancy.
