      Climbing is the activity of using one's hands, feet, or any other part of
      the body to ascend a steep topographical object. It is done for
      locomotion, recreation and competition, and within trades that rely on
      ascension; such as emergency rescue and military operations. It is done
      indoors and out, on natural and man-made structures.

      Professional mountain guides or rock climbing guides, such as members of
      the IFMGA, have been known to be a historically significant element of
      developing the popularity of the sport in the natural environment, and
      remain so today.

      Climbing will be an official sport for the first time in the 2021 Olympic
      Games in Tokyo (see Sport climbing at the 2020 Summer Olympics)
